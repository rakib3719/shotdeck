Hello Kuyrem1,

I hope you're doing well.



The "Forgot Password" feature will only work if the entered email is valid and already registered in the website's database.
If the email is not found, the feature won’t work. I’ve added a proper message to show when the user clicks "Forgot Password."



For video thumbnails, if no custom thumbnail is added, I’ll try to use the YouTube thumbnail automatically. I still need to do a bit more research for this.



I’ll update the video popup as well, and I’ve noted everything you shared.



Regarding video quality: for the best results, it's always better to upload high-resolution videos. I’ve tried Cloudinary’s default settings to improve low-quality videos — while it doesn't fully fix poor quality, it helps a little.



This website is fully customized using the MERN stack and is primarily hosted on Vercel for demonstration. If you want to customize simple things like the logo, website name, or small changes, I have added a settings option on the dashboard. For any other changes, coding will be needed.

Please let me know what changes you want, and I will update them.



Thanks again for your feedback !
